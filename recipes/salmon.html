        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Fresh, Asian-inspired salmon fillets with a crispy skin and an orange, ginger, and honey glaze. 
            Unlike most similar recipes, this one is made without soy sauce and with totally fresh ingredients.
             The result is a bright, fresh fish with great taste and texture. 
             The fresh ingredients are the star here: 
             Don't substitute with dried, powdered, or frozen ingredients!
              I served on top of rice and steamed broccoli garnished with green onions.

            <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 skin-on salmon filets</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine orange juice, honey, vinegar, olive oil, garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag.
                 Add salmon. Seal and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a large cast iron skillet in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully remove skillet from oven when it just barely starts to smoke. 
                Add vegetable oil and place salmon fillets, skin-side down, in the skillet. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the hot oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, or to your desired doneness, 5 to 9 minutes. Serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
